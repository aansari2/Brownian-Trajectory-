# Brownian motion trajectory integration
Monte carlo simulatation of trajectory of nanoparticles in rarified gas on MATLAB.

Example: 100nm particle starting at velocity [0;0;-1] m/s under [-0,0,9.8] m/s^2 acceleration for 1 second experiencing trajectory deviations due to brownian motion of 300K air in 0.1Pa vacuum.

Trajectory calculation based on:

Li, Amy, and Goodarz Ahmadi. "Dispersion and deposition of spherical particles from point sources in a turbulent channel flow." Aerosol science and technology 16.4 (1992): 209-226.
